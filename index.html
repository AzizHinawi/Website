           <center><font face = "Comic sans MS" size ="2">8/25/23 - We learned the basics of this class and what to do, including changing the type of lettering, and much more. We also learned how to put pictures and one of my favorites, a marquee. Today, on August 25, the whole class was able to do a "challenge" which we all participated in. The challenge consisted of two teams, and each team had about 8 poles. They were both given a marble and were told to consecutively get the marble in each pole and make it to the bucket. This challenge was to show the idea of the "goal" and what it exactly takes in order to get to that point.</font><br /></center>

            <center><font face = "Comic sans MS" size ="2">9/15/23 -  Today, we were lucky enough to be able to finish our rube goldberg machine. It felt like a cery tough challenge, and I feel like everyone else could possibly say the same. If I am not lying, I was very frustrated at some times, especially when the needle on the cardboard wouldn't work, but we were able to manage and tune it for it to work. The first main issue that we came across was when the baseball was not fitting through the cardboard hole, and to fix that, we just cut an even bigger whole in order for the ball to go through. Another problem that we faced was when the string that connected to the needle did not function, and the seesaw wouldn't project the piece with enough pressure, which did not pop the balloon. We decided to add more weight on the little piece and we also added two strings that made the piece face forward so the needle would pop the balloon with no trouble.</font><br/></center>

           <center><font face = "Comic sans MS" size ="2">9/25/23 - This is my third journal entry, and today I will be talking about what we recently have been doing in our class. Last week, we all were assigned a challenge, and that chalenge was to create a boat out of a piece of paper in order to be able to float some scraps. Me and my partner decided to try making a little box in order to put the scraps into the box. Once we tried it in the water, it sank immediately and we had no chance against everyone else. The most a person was able to do was probably 87 grams, and that was apparently the record out of all the classes. Mr. Kim at the end of class shared that we all could of just left the paper as it was and it would have still floated a lot,m and that was because there is nothing that is bothering the paper into sinking, which causes it to stay afloat with all of the scraps.I am excited to know what type of challenge or lab we are going to do next time, especially disecting the computer parts.</font><br/></center>

            <center><font face = "Comic sans MS" size ="2">9/29/23 - This is my fourth journal entry and this week, we did a lot of things during our class. My favorite activity that was the most fun for me haas to be the day where we all disected a desktop computer from the school. I will add pictures under this paragraph, but I am going to talk about the process during the whole disection. At first, I was so confused on where to start, but luckily there were little green arrows scattered around the inside of the computer, so we started off by taking off the top, and the disk drive. After that, we looked at the storage and all of the wires that were connected to everything throughout the insides of the computer. After finish9ing the whole computer, and dssecting everything, we were told to put the whole computer back together and after we did that, me and my partner noticed that there was one wire that was outside and we had no clue where it would go. We ended up figuring it out, but putting it into the storage and the disk drive, and whenever Mr. Kin went to test it, it turned on and I know that I for sure felt accomplished.</font></br></center>

            <center><font face = "Comic sans MS" size ="2"> 10/3/23 - Today we decided to work on a prosthenic arm. The context behind this was that we wathed a video about how prsthenic arms could help humans in the real world. Although, if there is a malfunction, they could hurt really bad or the subject and the person doing the action. Me and my partner were taking the easy but simple approach, which meant that we used cardboard, but we traced our hands onto it and made the fingers a bit longer. After that, we added rubber bands on each bending part of each finger, and then after that we decided to make string to attach all of the fingers and we were able to pick up the water bottle in the end.</font><br/></center>

           <center><font face = "Comic sans MS" size ="2"> 10/20/23 - This whole week, we were told to make a bottle rocket. So my group and I decided to make a bottle rocket with a decent design. Firstly, we started off by CADing the main design of what we wanted the bottle rocket to look like, amd after that we did a bit of touch ups in order to get it to look perfect for when we start making the actual rocket. Now yesterday, we started to build the bottle rocket, and since we only had that one day to make it, I was pretty stressed about what we were suposed to do or make. As the class kept progressing, we made the rocket and we added some fun things to it, including adding a nice little "sponser" onto one of the flappers of the rocket. In the end, we hot glued everythig together and we were hoping that everything would go alright and just fine. Although, today when we started doing the actual rocket tests, I got pretty nervous, knowing that the rocket might not go as far as I'd expect it too. So when Mr. Kim started to pressurize our rocket, it took a hefty time, and after that, he launched it and I was pretty shocked. It basically went up a bit and started to ride the floor like a car.</font></center>

            <center><font face = "Comic sans MS" size ="2"> 10/26/23 - Today we were trying to filter some pretty dirty water for our engineering class. I'd like to also mention that it did not work at all and it was basically a complete waste of time because it really did not work when we tried to make it filter. Instead, we ended up with dirty water in the end, and it felt like the competition was unmatchable and impossible since they got the new and clean water from the sink.</font></font></center>

            <center><font face = "Comic sans MS" size ="2"> 11/3/23 - Today we decided to do some programming with lights and arduino's. It was kind of fun but pretty frustrating at first, but eventually we go the hang of it and we were able to turn the LED light on. After that, we eventually made something that was called a sequence, and it was challenging. Although, me and my partner powered through and made the sequence light on, and after some time, after a whole day infact, the next class we go the option to program the lights and make patterns with them. It was pretty fun, at least the end part was, trying to copy down the code and everything was hard but we got the patterns to turn on and down here will be a video of the sequence.</font><br/></center>

            <center><font face = "Comic Sans MS" size ="2"> 12/1/23 - 2 days ago we were practicing in order to finish a projext that we had to make a simple object that can potentially be helpful to the environment or even the world, and in this case, we made a sort of health ring, and even though there are many of them in the world, we still decided to because there are many of them but are very changeable. So we called it Aura ring or something like that, and when we practiced, we didnt have that much time, but we were still abke to practice enough. After that we presented our project amd were able to get a good enough grade on it.</font></center>
